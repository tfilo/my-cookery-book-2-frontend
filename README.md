# My cookery book 2 - frontend

Frontend application providing GUI build in React.js. Whole frontend is writen in Typescript.

## Technologies required for development

-   Node.js (>=20)
-   Docker (>=26.0.1)
-   Docker compose (>=2.26.1)

## Development

While development it is required to have Postgres database and Backend running. It can be runned by prepared `docker-compose.yaml` file. This development environment can be started by command:

-   `docker compose up -d`

It will run pgAdmin on port 8082 and database on port 5432 and backend on port 8080 and internal api on port 8081 (not used in frontend).

After database and backend is running, you can start development server by commands:

-   `npm install` (only if you didn't run it before or you modifed package.json file)
-   `npm run generate-openapi` (only if you need generate openapi without starting/buildin app)
-   `npm start`

React App will start in development mode on port 3000.
